This repository collects data and code from Hardy et al (2024) <i>Delineating redox cooperativity in water-soluble and membrane multiheme cytochromes through protein design</i> Protein Science 33(8):e5113 (https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5113)

The files collected here are also available as part of the supplementary materials for that paper.
